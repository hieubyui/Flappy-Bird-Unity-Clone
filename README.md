# Overview

My first dive at Unity Game Engine. I attempt to recreate the hit game Flappy Bird.

You play as a bird that has to traverse through pipes. Each traversal awards you one point. Hitting the pipe ends the game and lets you Play Again. The game has a UI, takes in user input, and is able to be looped.

I wrote this software to learn Unity for the first time.
